          My name is Ana Chicaiza and I am 26 years old. I was born in Quito,
          Ecuador but my family moved to Spain when I was 3 years old. When I
          was 19 I decided London was a good place to start working and improve
          my English. My first job was as a waitress. I had already been living
          in London for 2 years when I had the opportunity to apply for
          university. It was the best decision in my life. I am in my second
          year of a degree called BSc Applied Computing. She Codes workshops
          have helped me a lot to understand coding and I have also found it
          very entertaining and didactic which is what I needed because
          sometimes it is very difficult for me to concentrate.

          I love reading and one of my favorites books is "Hundred years of
          solitude" by Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Tim Burton is my favorite film
          and one of my favorite films is "Nightmare Before Christmas" and "The
          Corpse Bridge". When I was 7 years old I loved to play football but
          when I got older I switched to basketball. I don't play every day but
          I usually get together with my friends to play every other weekend. I
          prefer summer to winter and a walk in the mountains to a walk on the
          beach. I see more beauty in cloudy days than in sunny days, although
          it is true that sunny days bring more happiness.
